# Talofa!

My name is Joseph, although I’m known by most as Iosefa, and I work full time as a software engineer at [Georepublic](https://georepublic.info/en/) while pursuing my phd in ecology with the [Kitajima group](https://netsurin.wordpress.com/) at [Kyoto University](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en). 

At [Georepublic](https://georepublic.info/en/), I lead small specialized teams to develop GIS solutions and geospatially driven software applications for business and research. I primarily focus on developing server-side applications for geospatially enabled API’s as well as algorithm design for complex optimization and routing problems.

At [Kyoto University](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en), I study forest structure and community dynamics in Madagascar white sand forests. I am interested in understanding how spatial patterns of habitat patches affect community dynamics and species composition in nutrient poor forests. I am also a member of a [research group](https://www.jst.go.jp/global/axis/en/field/b_03_kitajima.html) to assess ecosystem services of North Western dry forests and the potential of sustainable development with REDD+ in Madagascar. 

I received my Masters degree in Environmental Management from [Graduate School of Global Environmental Studies at Kyoto University](https://www2.ges.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/) and my undergraduate degree in Physics, Economics, and Environmental Studies from [Brandeis University](https://www.brandeis.edu/). I was a graduate student researcher with the [Saizen Group](http://lrp.ges.kyoto-u.ac.jp/) at Kyoto University where I focused on developing geographically weighted statistical methods, and a teaching assistant in several introductory GIS and Environmental Studies classes at both Brandeis and Kyoto University. I also worked as a student manager and technician at the [Brandeis University Technology Help Desk](https://www.brandeis.edu/its/support/helpdesk/).
